The contest was organized as follows:

Round 1
-------
Judges gave a simple yes/no for each submission. Submissions with majority
(strictly greater than four) yes votes moved on to Round 2.


Round 2
-------
Judges scored each entry according to

* Originality - 10 points.
  * Is the submission interesting, does it exhibit a novel technique for
    hiding bugs, etc.?
* Effectiveness - 10 points.
  * How much damage does the submission cause (e.g. complete key
    recovery would rank higher than leaking a few bytes of plaintext).
* Difficulty of Detection - 10 points.
  * How hard would it be for someone to spot the backdoor? Consider both
    experts (e.g. during a formal code audit), and non-experts (e.g.
    a non-crypto-expert maintainer merging a pull requests on GitHub).
* Judge's Discretion - 5 points.
  * Room for the judges to give bonus points to truly exceptional
    submissions.

Round 3
-------
The top-four scoring entries were brought into Round 3. The judges decided
[GaetanLeurent](GaetanLeurent) and [JohnMeacham](JohnMeacham/underhanded/)
should be the winners, except in opposite order to their relative scores
since JohnMeacham's submission has more practical implications.

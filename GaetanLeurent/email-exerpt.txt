Dear Organizers,

Here is my submission to the Underhanded Crypto competition.

It adds a backdoor to a proof-of-concept implementation of Stern's 
authentication algorithm by Cayrel et al.

Please find attached a description of the backdoor, and the patch. (The 
original implementation from Cayrel et al. is available from: 
https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B4Cy03-L745ZdW8xQ2JTaWRMYzA)

Best regards,

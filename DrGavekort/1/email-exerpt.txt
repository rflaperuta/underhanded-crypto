Spendon Gavekort [my pseudonym]: "KALE: A High-Degree
Algebraic-Resistant Variant of The Advanced Encryption Standard".

The main body of the text is just a goofy diversion, the backdoor is
described in Appendix B on the last page. I also have reference
implementations (which only differ from AES in the S-Boxes).

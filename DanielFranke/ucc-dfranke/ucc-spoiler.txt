Curve UCC-256 is "anomalous", meaning that the order of the curve is
equal to the order of its base field. I hid this fact from visual
inspection by incorrectly giving its order as 53*p rather than p; this
will not prevent most cryptographic operations from succeeding. The
discrete log problem on anomalous elliptic curves can be solved in
linear time.

The following paper describes the method which I used to find this
curve and provides a brief summary of the attack:

Vaudenay, 1995. "Generating Anomalous Elliptic Curves".

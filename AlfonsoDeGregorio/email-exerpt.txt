Hello!

Thank you for organizing the Underhanded Crypto Contest. This is a
timely initiative which I welcome.

Please find attached illusoryTLS, my submission to the 'Add a
Backdoor' category.

Being unsure if the judges are expected to have access to the crypto
design and to the explanation of the bug during the code review phase,
I am attaching the implementation and the design as two separate
files. Please, distribute them as appropriate.

I welcome any feedback from you on the above and I wish everybody good
luck with the contest.

Thank you.

Ciao,
